# TypeScript Game

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

<!-- Create a working Game: The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your understanding of TypeScript but how you break down a problem.

Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.

Get a better understanding of how to scope a larger project: We want to see a clear plan of what you're going to build and how.

Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad! -->

Phraser - a single player, online guessing game inspired by Articulate.

Players will have 2 minutes to guess as many correct answers they can based on prompts given from different categories. They will have the option to receive an additional hint at the cost of a lower score. At the end of 2 minutes, they will be provided with their score and their high score will be tracked.

## HTML / SCSS

- [ ] a display showing the question card
- [ ] a display showing player score
- [ ] an input for player answer
- [ ] a display tracking players highest score
- [ ] a display which shows player time remaining
- [ ] styling to differentiate different categories
    - [ ] include a key so players can check this / some form of header stating which category the prompt currently falls under
- [ ] accessible instructions
- [ ] styling to show if the answer is correct
